Doorkeeper is an oAuth2 provider built in Ruby. It integrates with Ruby on Rails and Grape frameworks.

## Installation

The installation process depends on the framework you're using. The first step is to add `doorkeeper` to your `Gemfile`:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="# Gemfile" %}
```ruby
gem 'doorkeeper'
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

And run `bundle install`. After this, make sure to follow the guide related to the framework you're using below.

### Ruby on Rails

Doorkeeper follows Rails maintenance policy and supports only supported versions of the framework.
Currently we support Ruby on Rails 5 and higher. See the guide [here](ruby-on-rails/getting-started.md).

### Grape
